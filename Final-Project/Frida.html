        <h2>Frida Khalo </h2>
        <h3> July 6, 1907, Coyoacán, Mex.—died July 13, 1954.</h3>

        <p> Frida Kahlo is a Mexican painter. <br>
            Daughter of a German Jewish photographer, she had polio as a child. At 18 suffered a serious bus accident.
            She subsequently underwent some 35 operations; during her recovery, she taught herself to paint. <br> 
            She is noted for her intense self-portraits, many reflecting her physical ordeal. <br> 
            Like many artists working in post-revolutionary Mexico, Kahlo was influenced by Mexican folk art;
            this is apparent in her use of fantastical elements and bold use of colour, and in her depictions of herself wearing traditional Mexican, rather than European-style, dress. 
            Her marriage to painter Diego Rivera (from 1929) was tumultuous but artistically rewarding.<br> 
            The Surrealists André Breton and Marcel Duchamp helped arrange exhibits of her work in the U.S. and Europe, 
            and though she denied the connection, the dreamlike quality of her work has often led historians to identify her as a Surrealist. <br> 
            She died at 47. Her house in Coyoacán is now the Frida Kahlo Museum.</p>

           <h2>Her Work </h2>
           <p> Frida Kahlo made creation her philosophy, in which she used art as a catharsis mechanism for a life full of fluctuating events.<br>
            Exploring the context of her time with a vision that always seemed ahead of its time, Frida was a voice and an image in art and society, 
            dedicated to the representation of women in modernity and with the objective of elevating the Mexican identity. <br>
            Frida Kahlo's work began from the portrait of people close to their lives, those who helped to assume the identity of other
             unknown characters in Kahlo's paintings. Her early pieces are compared to European classical art, 
             also repeatedly compared to the Renaissance technique, used by painters such as Botticelli and Bronzino.<br>
              Kahlo's works navigate between descriptions of the avant-garde movements, the new objectivity and cubism. 
              A period of her life took a turn in the style of her painting, bringing her inspiration and style closer to Mexican folklore. 
              Art historians suggest that Frida Kahlo's approach to Mexican roots may have been influenced by Adolfo Best Maugard's work on the same subject, 
              where the lack of perspective and the combination of elements from the pre-Hispanic periods of Mexican art were predominant.</p>

                   <h2>The Casa Azul Museum </h2>
                   <p> The Casa Azul (Blue House) is Frida Kahlo’s private universe. She spent most of her life here, first with her family and, years later, 
                    at Diego Rivera’s side. They hosted a fascinating array of luminaries from Mexico and abroad, drawn by the charisma of both artists.<br>
                    Frida and Diego wanted to leave her house as a museum for all Mexicans to enjoy. At her death, the couple’s friend, museographer and poet Carlos Pellicer 
                    did the exhibition design. Its administration was assigned to a trust, the Fideicomiso de los Museos Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo, under the central bank, 
                    Banco de México, and constituted by Rivera himself in 1957.<br><br>
                    Since its inauguration in July 1958, the Casa Azul and its gardens have displayed personal objects and paintings by both artists, folk art, 
                    Pre-Columbian sculpture, photos, documents, books, and furnishings that were part of the ambience where Frida was inspired to create. </p>
